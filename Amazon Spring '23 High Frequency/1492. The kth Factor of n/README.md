# 1492. The kth Factor of n

## Introduction

This technical document describes a JavaScript function that calculates the kth factor of a given positive integer. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0. The function returns the kth factor in ascending order or -1 if there are fewer than k factors.

## Function Signature

```javascript
function kthFactor(n, k)
```

### Parameters

- `n` (number): The positive integer for which factors need to be calculated.
- `k` (number): The position of the factor to be returned.

### Return Value

- The kth factor of n if it exists.
- -1 if n has fewer than k factors.

## Approach

The approach to finding the kth factor of an integer n involves the following steps:

1. Initialize an empty array `factors` to store the factors of n.
2. Iterate from 1 to n and check if i is a factor of n by checking if n % i === 0.
3. If i is a factor, add it to the `factors` array.
4. After iterating through all the numbers up to n, check if k is within the range of the `factors` array.
5. If k is a valid index in the `factors` array, return the kth factor.
6. Otherwise, return -1 to indicate that there are fewer than k factors.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const n = 12;
const k = 3;
const result = kthFactor(n, k);
console.log(result); // Output: 3
```

In this example, we want to find the 3rd factor of the number 12. The function `kthFactor` is called with the values `n = 12` and `k = 3`. The result is stored in the `result` variable. Finally, the result is printed to the console, which will output `3`.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the function is O(n) because we iterate from 1 to n to find the factors. In the worst case, when n is large, the function will take more time to execute.

The space complexity of the function is O(f), where f is the number of factors of n. The factors are stored in the `factors` array, which can grow up to the size of n. Therefore, the space required by the function increases with the input size.

## Conclusion

The `kthFactor` function provides a way to find the kth factor of a given positive integer. It follows a simple approach of finding all the factors and returning the kth factor if it exists. This function can be useful in scenarios where the factors of an integer need to be calculated, and a specific factor at a given position is required.
