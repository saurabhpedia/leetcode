# isPalindrome Function

The `isPalindrome` function is used to determine whether a given singly linked list is a palindrome.

## Syntax

```javascript
function isPalindrome(head: ListNode | null): boolean
```

## Parameters

- `head`: The head node of the singly linked list.

## Return Value

- The function returns `true` if the linked list is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

## Algorithm

1. If the linked list is empty or contains only one node, return `true` since it is considered a palindrome.
2. Use the "slow and fast pointer" technique to find the middle of the linked list:
   - Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head node.
   - Move `slow` one step at a time and `fast` two steps at a time until `fast` reaches the end of the linked list.
   - At this point, `slow` will be pointing to the middle node (or the first node of the second half if the list has an odd number of nodes).
3. Reverse the second half of the linked list:
   - Initialize two pointers, `prev` and `curr`, both pointing to `null` and `slow`, respectively.
   - While `curr` is not `null`:
     - Store the next node of `curr` in a temporary variable `next`.
     - Set the `next` pointer of `curr` to `prev`.
     - Move `prev` to `curr` and `curr` to `next`.
   - After the loop, `prev` will be pointing to the head of the reversed second half.
4. Compare the reversed second half with the first half of the linked list:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` pointing to the head of the linked list, and `right` pointing to `prev` (the head of the reversed second half).
   - While `right` is not `null`:
     - If the values of `left` and `right` are not equal, return `false` since the linked list is not a palindrome.
     - Move `left` to the next node and `right` to the next node.
5. If the loop completes without returning `false`, return `true` since the linked list is a palindrome.

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Definition for a singly linked list node
class ListNode {
  constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
  }
}

// Create a sample linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
const node4 = new ListNode(1);
const node3 = new ListNode(2, node4);
const node2 = new ListNode(3, node3);
const node1 = new ListNode(2, node2);
const head = new ListNode(1, node1);

console.log(isPalindrome(head)); // Output: true
```

In this example, the `isPalindrome` function is called with the head of a linked list containing the values `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. It determines whether the linked list is a palindrome and returns `true` since the list contains a palindrome sequence.
