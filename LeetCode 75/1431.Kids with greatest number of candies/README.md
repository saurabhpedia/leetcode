# Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

## Introduction
The "Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies" algorithm aims to determine, for each kid, whether they can have the greatest number of candies after receiving a certain number of extra candies. The algorithm takes an array `candies`, where each element represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, representing the number of extra candies you have. It returns a boolean array `result`, where `result[i]` is `true` if the ith kid can have the greatest number of candies, or `false` otherwise.

## Algorithm
The algorithm follows the following steps:

1. Find the maximum number of candies among all the kids using the `Math.max(...candies)` function and store it in the variable `maxCandies`.
2. Initialize an empty array `result` to store the boolean values.
3. Iterate through each kid's candy count in the `candies` array using a loop.
4. For each kid, check if their current candy count plus the `extraCandies` is greater than or equal to the `maxCandies`. If it is, push `true` to the `result` array; otherwise, push `false`.
5. Return the `result` array as the output.

## Pseudocode
The pseudocode for the "Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies" algorithm is as follows:

```
function kidsWithCandies(candies, extraCandies):
    maxCandies = Math.max(...candies)
    result = []
  
    for i = 0 to candies.length - 1:
        result.push(candies[i] + extraCandies >= maxCandies)
  
    return result
```

## Example
Here's an example demonstrating the usage of the algorithm:

```javascript
const candies = [2, 3, 5, 1, 3]
const extraCandies = 3
const result = kidsWithCandies(candies, extraCandies)
console.log(result)  // Output: [true, true, true, false, true]
```

In this example, the algorithm correctly determines whether each kid can have the greatest number of candies after receiving the extra candies.

## Constraints
The algorithm satisfies the following constraints:

- `n` is the length of the `candies` array.
- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= candies[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= extraCandies <= 50`

## Conclusion
The "Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies" algorithm provides a way to determine, for each kid, whether they can have the greatest number of candies after receiving a certain number of extra candies. By finding the maximum number of candies among all the kids and comparing it with each kid's candy count with the extra candies, the algorithm efficiently determines the result. It can be used in scenarios where you want to identify which kids can have the most candies after additional candies are distributed.
